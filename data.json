{"across": {"1": "toSearchTeetotalism is the practice or promotion of complete personal abstinence from alcoholic beverages. A person who practises (and possibly advocates) teetotalism is called a teetotaler (plural teetotalers) or is simply said to be teetotal.  The teetotalism movement was first started in Preston, England, in the early 19th century. The Preston Temperance Society was founded in 1833 by Joseph Livesey, who was to become a leader of the temperance movement and the author of The Pledge: \"We agree to abstain from all liquors of an intoxicating quality whether ale, porter, wine or ardent spirits, except as medicine.\" Today, a number of temperance organizations exist that promote teetotalism as a virtue.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the etymological dictionaries, the tee- in teetotal is the letter \u2039t\u203a, so it is actually t-total, though it was never spelled that way. The word is first recorded in 1832 in a general sense in an Irish-American source, and in 1833 in England in the context of abstinence. Since at first it was used in other contexts as an emphasised form of total, the tee- is presumably a reduplication of the first letter of total, much as contemporary idiom today might say \"total with a capital T\". Possibly a reinterpretation to mean temperance total influenced the semantic development; it is said that as early as 1827 in some Temperance Societies signing a \"T\" after one's name had signified one's pledge to temperance.\nHowever there have also been other explanations of the T. One anecdote attributes the origin of the word to a meeting of the Preston Temperance Society in 1833. The story attributes the word to Richard Turner, a member of the society, who in a speech said \"I'll be reet down out-and-out t-t-total for ever and ever.\" Walter William Skeat noted that the Turner anecdote had been recorded by temperance advocate Joseph Livesey, and posited that the term may have been inspired by the teetotum; however, James B. Greenough stated that \"nobody ever thought teetotum and teetotaler were etymologically connected.\"A variation on the above account is found on the pages of The Charleston Observer: \n\nTeetotalers.\u2014The origin of this convenient word, (as convenient almost, although not so general in its application as loafer,) is, we imagine, known but to few who use it. It originated, as we learn from the Landmark, with a man named Turner, a member of the Preston Temperance Society, who, having an impediment of speech, in addressing a meeting remarked, that partial abstinence from intoxicating liquors would not do; they must insist upon tee-tee-(stammering) tee total abstinence. Hence total abstainers have been called teetotalers.\nAccording to historian Daniel Walker Howe (What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848, 2007) the term was derived from the practice of American preacher and temperance advocate Lyman Beecher.  He would take names at his meetings of people who pledged alcoholic temperance and noted those who pledged total abstinence with a T. Such persons became known as Teetotallers.\n\n\n== Reasons and justifications ==\nSome common reasons for choosing teetotalism are psychological, religious, health, medical, familial, philosophical, social, past alcoholism, or sometimes it is simply a matter of taste or preference.  When at drinking establishments, teetotalers (or teetotallers) either abstain from drinking completely, or consume non-alcoholic beverages such as water, juice, tea, coffee, non-alcoholic soft drinks, virgin drinks, mocktails, and alcohol-free beer.\nMost teetotaler organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nAbstention from alcohol is a tenet of a number of religious faiths, including Hinduism, such as the Swaminarayans; Sikhism; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds; Jains; and Meivazhi-ites.\n\"Khamr\" is the term for all intoxicants which are prohibited in Islam. (See Religion and alcohol \u00a7 Islam) \nSimilarly, one of the five precepts of Buddhism is abstaining from intoxicating substances that disturb the peace and self-control of the mind, but it is formulated as a training rule to be assumed voluntarily rather than as a commandment.\nMany Christian groups, such as Methodists and Quakers, are often associated with teetotalism due to their traditionally strong support for temperance movements, as well as prohibition. And a number of Christian denominations forbid the consumption of alcohol, including the New Order Amish, Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Seventh-day Adventists, Mennonites (both Old Order and Conservative), Church of the Brethren members, and Christian Scientists. Many members of these religious groups are also required to refrain from selling such products. A translation of the New Testament, the Purified Translation of the Bible, translates in a way that promotes teetotalism. \nWith respect to Methodism, the Church of the Nazarene and Wesleyan Methodist Church, both denominations in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition, teach abstinence from alcohol. members of denominations in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, practice temperance and teetotalism, thus abstaining from alcohol and other drugs. Uniformed members of the Salvation Army (\"soldiers\" and \"officers\") make a promise on joining the movement to observe lifelong abstinence from alcohol. This dates back to the early years of the organisation, and the missionary work among alcoholics. \nWith respect to Restorationist Christianity, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints abstain from alcoholic drinks (and other substances) based on their adherence to the faith's code of health called \"The Word of Wisdom\".\nEastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Anglican Communion all require wine in their central religious rite of the eucharist, and while other Protestant churches often allow grape juice or alcohol-free wine in their communion services, only a few require a non-alcoholic beverage as official policy. (See Christianity and alcohol.) \nSome Christians choose to practice teetotalism throughout the Lent season, thus giving up alcoholic beverages as their Lenten sacrifice.\n\n\n== Research on non-drinkers ==\nDominic Conroy and Richard de Visser published research in Psychology and Health which studied strategies used by college students who would like to resist peer pressure to drink alcohol in social settings. The research hinted that students are less likely to give in to peer pressure if they have strong friendships and make a decision not to drink before social interactions.A 2015 study by the Office for National Statistics showed that young Britons were more likely to be teetotalers than their parents.According to Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, published by WHO in 2011, close to half of the world\u2019s adult population (45 per cent) are life-time abstainers. The Eastern Mediterranean Region, consisting of the Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa, is by far the lowest alcohol consuming region in the world, both in terms of total adult per capita consumption and prevalence of non-drinkers, i.e. 87.8 per cent lifetime abstainers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nBlue ribbon badge\nCatch-my-Pal\nList of Temperance organizations\nTheobald Mathew (temperance reformer)\nPioneer Total Abstinence Association\nSobriety\nStraight edge\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n The dictionary definition of teetotal at WiktionaryThe Challenge: Total Madness is the thirty-fifth  season of the MTV reality competition series The Challenge.

It is their sixth British and eighth American studio album, and their first to be released in identical versions in both countries. The album's title is a play on the \"Her Britannic Majesty requests and requires...\" text that appears inside a British passport.\nThe band experimented with a psychedelic sound on Satanic Majesties, incorporating unconventional elements such as Mellotron, sound effects, string arrangements, and African rhythms. The album was self-produced by the band following the departure of longtime manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham, and the prolonged recording process was marked by drug use, court appearances, and jail terms by members of the band. The original LP cover features a lenticular image by photographer Michael Cooper.\nSatanic Majesties received mixed reactions from critics and members of the group itself. The album was criticised as being derivative of the contemporaneous work of the Beatles, particularly their June 1967 release Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, with the similarities extending to the LP's cover. In subsequent decades, however, it has gradually risen in critical reputation. Following the album's release, the Rolling Stones abandoned their psychedelic style for a stripped-down return to their roots in blues music.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nRecording of Their Satanic Majesty's Request began just after the release of Between the Buttons on 20 January 1967. \nBecause of court appearances and jail terms, the entire band was seldom present in the studio at one time, making recording of the album lengthy and disjointed. Band members frequently arrived with guests in tow, further interfering with productivity. One of the more level-headed members of the band during this time, Bill Wyman, wary of psychedelic drugs, wrote the song \"In Another Land\" to parody the Stones' current goings-on. In his 2002 book Rolling with the Stones, Wyman describes the situations in the studio:\n\nEvery day at the studio it was a lottery as to who would turn up and what \u2013 if any \u2013 positive contribution they would make when they did. Keith would arrive with anywhere up to ten people, Brian with another half-a-dozen and it was the same for Mick. They were assorted girlfriends and friends. I hated it! Then again, so did Andrew (Oldham) and just gave up on it. There were times when I wish I could have done, too.\n\nAccording to Brian Jones, a month before the album's planned release date the group \"hadn't got anything put together.\"\nThe Stones experimented with many new instruments and sound effects during the sessions, including Mellotron, theremin, short wave radio static, and string arrangements by then-future Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Their producer and manager Andrew Loog Oldham, already fed up with the band's lack of focus, distanced himself from them following their drug bust and finally quit, leaving them without a producer. As a result, Their Satanic Majesties Request would be the Stones' first self-produced album. Mick Jagger later opined this was not for the best:\n\nThere's a lot of rubbish on Satanic Majesties. Just too much time on our hands, too many drugs, no producer to tell us, \"Enough already, thank you very much, now can we just get on with this song?\" Anyone let loose in the studio will produce stuff like that. There was simply too much hanging around. It's like believing everything you do is great and not having any editing.\nIt's really like sort of got-together chaos. Because we all panicked a little, even as soon as a month before the release date that we had planned, we really hadn't got anything put together. We had all these great things that we'd done, but we couldn't possibly put it out as an album. And so we just got them together, and did a little bit of editing here and there.\nSome of the album's songs were recorded under various working titles, some appearing rather non-sequitous and radically different from the final titles. These working titles include: \"Acid in the Grass\" (\"In Another Land\"), \"I Want People to Know\" (\"2000 Man\"), \"Flowers in Your Bonnet\" (\"She's a Rainbow\"), \"Fly My Kite\" (\"The Lantern\"), \"Toffee Apple\" (\"2000 Light Years from Home\"), and \"Surprise Me\" (\"On with the Show\"). In 1998, a bootleg box set of eight CDs with outtakes from the Satanic sessions was released, and it shows the band developing the songs over multiple takes as well as the experimentation that went into the recording of the album.\n\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe working title of the album was Cosmic Christmas, or The Rolling Stones' Cosmic Christmas \u2013 in the hidden coda titled \"Cosmic Christmas\" (following \"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\"), Wyman says in a slowed-down voice: \"We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, and a happy New Year!'\" The album was released in South Africa and the Philippines as The Stones Are Rolling because of the word \"Satanic\" in the title.One proposed cover, a photograph of Jagger naked on a cross, was scrapped by the record company for being \"in bad taste\". Initial LP and reel-to-reel releases of the album featured a three-dimensional picture of the band on the cover by photographer Michael Cooper. When viewed in a certain way, the lenticular image shows the band members' faces turning towards each other with the exception of Jagger, whose hands appear crossed in front of him. Looking closely on its cover, one can see the faces of each of the four Beatles, reportedly a response to the Beatles' inclusion of a Shirley Temple doll wearing a \"Welcome the Rolling Stones\" sweater on the cover of Sgt. Pepper. Later editions replaced the glued-on three-dimensional image with a photograph, due to high production costs. A limited edition LP version in the 1980s reprinted the original 3D cover design; immediately following the reissue, the master materials for reprinting the 3D cover were intentionally destroyed. The 3D album cover was featured, although shrunk down, for the Japanese SHM-CD release in 2010.The original cover design called for the lenticular image to take up the entire front cover, but finding this to be prohibitively expensive it was decided to reduce the size of the photo and surround it with the blue-and-white graphic design.\nThe entire cover design is elaborate, with a dense photo collage filling most of the inside cover (along with a maze) designed by Michael Cooper, and a painting by Tony Meeuwissen on the back cover depicting the four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, and Air).  In some editions the blue-and-white wisps on the front cover are used in a red-and-white version on the paper inner sleeve.  The inner-cover collage has dozens of images, taken from reproductions of old master paintings (Ingres, Poussin, da Vinci, among others), Indian mandalas and portraits, astronomy (including a large image of the planet Saturn), flowers, world maps, etc.  The maze on the inside cover of the UK and US releases cannot be completed: a wall at about a half radius in from the lower left corner means one can never arrive at the goal labeled \"It's Here\" in the centre of the maze.\nIt was the first of four Stones albums to feature a novelty cover; the others were the zipper on Sticky Fingers (1971), the cut-out faces on Some Girls (1978), and the stickers on Undercover (1983).\nAt some point around 1997 rumors were first heard that the album existed as a promo version including a silk padding. A pink padded version was presented by photo accompanied by a letter from the Decca Copyright Department, but it was shown that the letter does not match the album it was intended to authenticate making it almost entirely certain that this was a forgery.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nReleased in December 1967, Their Satanic Majesties Request reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 2 in the US (easily going gold), but its commercial performance declined rapidly. It was soon viewed as a pretentious, poorly conceived attempt to outdo the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (released in June 1967), often explained by drug trials and excesses in contemporary musical fashion, although John Lennon and Paul McCartney did provide backing vocals (uncredited) on \"We Love You\" (recorded during the Satanic Majesties Request sessions, but released as a single three months before the album). The Wyman-composed \"In Another Land\" was released as a single, with the artist credit listed as Bill Wyman, rather than the Rolling Stones (the B-Side, \"The Lantern\", was credited to the Rolling Stones).The production, in particular, came in for harsh criticism from Jon Landau in the fifth issue of Rolling Stone, and Jimmy Miller (recommended by the album's engineer, Glyn Johns) was asked to produce the Stones' subsequent albums, on which they would return to the hard driving blues that earned them fame early in their career. In an April 1968 album review, Richard Corliss of the New York Times was also critical of the production value stating \"...their imagination seems to have dried up when it comes to some of the arrangements. While still better than their previous ones, the arrangements are often ragged, fashionably monotonous and off-key.\" Despite this he gave the album an overall positive review, going as far as calling it a better concept album than Of Cabbages and Kings (1967, by Chad & Jeremy), The Beat Goes On (1968, by Vanilla Fudge) and even Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967, by the Beatles). In a 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented on the album: \"Satanic Majesties is Pepper. \"We Love You\"...that's \"All You Need Is Love\"\".\n\n\n== Legacy and reappraisal ==\nKeith Richards himself has been critical of the album in later years. While he likes some of the songs (\"2000 Light Years from Home\", \"Citadel\" and \"She's a Rainbow\"), he stated, \"the album was a load of crap.\" Mick Jagger disavowed the album in 1995, saying:  \"[...] it's not very good. It had interesting things on it, but I don't think any of the songs are very good. [...] There's two good songs on it [...] The rest of them are nonsense.\" There are only two songs from the album which the Stones performed live, \"2000 Light Years from Home\" (1989\u201390 world tour, 2013 Glastonbury Festival), and \"She's a Rainbow\" (1997\u201398 Bridges to Babylon Tour and occasionally on concert tours in the late 2010s).\nSatanic Majesties has been reassessed positively by critics. In a retrospective 1977 review, Robert Christgau of the Village Voice stated that the album \"no doubt contains several great songs\" despite negative reception from some. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Pitchfork wrote that \"Perhaps psychedelia wasn\u2019t a natural fit for the earthbound Stones, but the dissonance between their gritty rhythms and ornate, precocious arrangements is enthralling, not in the least because there\u2019s no other record\u2014by the Stones or anybody else\u2014that sounds quite like this.\" AllMusic's Bob Eder called the mono mix of the album a distinct improvement over the stereo version, describing it as transforming the maligned album into \"superb, punky psychedelia.\" Richie Unterberger of AllMusic writes:\n\nWithout a doubt, no Rolling Stones album \u2013 and, indeed, very few rock albums from any era \u2013 split critical opinion as much as the Rolling Stones' psychedelic outing. Many dismiss the record as sub-Sgt. Pepper posturing; others confess, if only in private, to a fascination with the album's inventive arrangements, which incorporated some African rhythms, Mellotrons, and full orchestration.  What's clear is that never before or after did the Stones take so many chances in the studio\u2026In 1968, the Stones would go back to the basics, and never wander down these paths again, making this all the more of a fascinating anomaly in the group's discography.\nTheir Satanic Majesties Request's opening song \"Sing This All Together\" was featured in the stage and television productions of Paul Sills' Story Theatre (1970\u201371), in particular appearing as the TV version's theme song. This song was also covered by the Swedish band \"Shakers\" as early as mars 1968 on a vinyl single as A-side. In 2008 it was included on a CD with \"Shakers\" entire catalog of songs titled \"Samlat Skrammel\". Todd Tamanend Clark released a proto-cyberpunk version of \"2000 Light Years From Home\" in 1975.  Punk/Goth pioneers The Damned covered \"Citadel\" on their 1981 Friday 13th (EP); guitarist Captain Sensible wanted to cover the entire album but singer Dave Vanian thought a single song was enough. California's Redd Kross also covered \"Citadel\" on their 1984 Teen Babes from Monsanto EP. Cibo Matto covered \"Sing This All Together\" on their album Super Relax (1997). The Ohio punk band Sister Ray included \"Citadel\" in many of their live sets. Sheffield new wave band The Comsat Angels also covered \"Citadel\" for BBC (Time Considered as a Helix of Precious Stones) and Dutch (Unravelled) radio sessions, and released it as a bonus 12\" to \"I'm Falling\", and on their fifth album, 7 Day Weekend. The Yugoslav band Elektri\u010dni Orgazam covered the song \"Citadel\" in 1983 on their cover album Les Chansones Populaires. American neo-psychedelic band The Brian Jonestown Massacre paid tribute to the album with their fourth album Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request. \"2000 Man\" was covered by KISS on their 1979 album Dynasty featuring lead guitarist Ace Frehley on lead vocals. Ace also used the song as the \"icebreaker\" when the original lineup performed on KISS Unplugged (1996).In August 2002, Their Satanic Majesties Request was reissued in a new remastered CD, LP and DSD by ABKCO Records. In May 2011, the album was reissued on SHM-SACD.} In 2017, a set containing two LPs (mono/stereo) as well as two SACDs (mono/stereo) was released. For the first time since the 2006 Japanese SACD release, the original 3D cover was recreated. In 2018, the album was reissued as part of the Record Store Day. The release contained a remastered stereo version of the album pressed on transparent colored vinyl (180g) and also featured the 3D-style sleeve.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks are written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except \"In Another Land\" by Bill Wyman.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSource:The Rolling Stones\n\nMick Jagger \u2013 lead vocals (all but 3), backing vocals (1, 3-9), percussion (1, 5, 8), maracas (2, 9, 10), glockenspiel (2), tambourine (6)\nKeith Richards \u2013 electric guitar (1, 2, 4, 5, 7-10), backing vocals (1, 3-9), acoustic guitar (3, 4, 6, 7), bass guitar (9)\nBrian Jones \u2013 Mellotron (1-3, 5-10), flute (2, 5, 10), backing vocals (5, 6), percussion (1, 5, 6), g\u00fciro (1, 5, 10), saxophone (1, 2, 10), sound effects (3, 9), acoustic guitar (4, 7), electric guitar (6), vibraphone (5), glockenspiel (1, 5), theremin (5, 9), jew's harp (5), brass (1, 5, 6), organ (7), electric dulcimer (2, 8, 9), recorder (8), sarod (8), harp (10)\nBill Wyman \u2013 bass guitar (1-8, 10), percussion (1, 5), lead vocals (3), piano (3), organ (3), Mellotron (5), oscillator (9)\nCharlie Watts \u2013 drums (2-7, 9, 10), tambourine (5, 10), percussion (1, 5, 6), congas (5), tabla (8), claves (10),Additional personnel\n\nNicky Hopkins \u2013 piano (1, 5-7, 9, 10), organ (4, 8), harpsichord (2, 3)\nJohn Paul Jones \u2013 string arrangement (6)\nRonnie Lane \u2013 backing vocals (3)\nSteve Marriott \u2013 backing vocals (3)\nEddie Kramer \u2013 claves (9)\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrian Jones & Mick Jagger interviewed on the Pop Chronicles (1969)\n\n\n== External links ==\nTheir Satanic Majesties Request at Discogs (list of releases)Courage and Hesitation: Notes and Photographs of the Nixon Administration is a 1971 non-fiction book by Allen Drury. It is an inside look at U. S. President Richard Nixon and those closest to him midway through his first term in office, with photographs by Fred J. Maroon.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nDrawn from Drury's interviews with Nixon and his political and White House staff, Courage and Hesitation also contains photographs by Fred J. Maroon. Impressed by Maroon's photography of Washington, D.C., Nixon had granted the photographer's request for access to the White House in 1970. Maroon later wrote, \"After Kennedy and Johnson nobody seemed to be running stories on the Nixon White House. The big news magazines just didn't like him, so I proposed a book.\" He continued photographing Nixon through the President's 1974 resignation, but except for what was published in Courage and Hesitation Maroon did not publish most of his Nixon work until his 1999 book The Nixon Years, 1969-1974, White House to Watergate.In Reelpolitik II: Political Ideologies in '50s and '60s Films (2004), Beverly Merrill Kelley wrote that Drury accepted the commission to write the book despite the fact that he found Nixon to be \"very weird, very odd.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nKirkus Reviews wrote, \"Unfortunately, Drury's peek behind the lace curtain came before the China initiative and the Freeze, and it all seems very old hat when Erlichman or Chotiner discuss the President's game plan.\" The review called the book \"a creampuff bore\" and \"dreary, dreary, dreary\".\n\n\n== References ==PHOTOGRAPHER Word Trends  IN A SENTENCE Grammar Coach Pricing cite desire seller's market

The novel was written over the course of eighteen months. Despite the length and difficult subject matter, it became a bestseller.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe novel follows the lives of four friends in New York City from college through to middle-age. It focuses particularly on Jude, a lawyer with a mysterious past, ambiguous ethnicity, and unexplained health issues. Jude walks with a limp and suffers from severe nerve damage in his spine that causes him great pain, which he blames on a car injury he sustained as a child. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, he also habitually self-harms. The rest of the group includes Malcolm, a struggling architect from a wealthy biracial family who still lives at home; JB, a painter of Haitian descent; and Willem, an aspiring actor whom Jude is closest with due to their both being orphans. After graduation, Jude and Willem share a one-bedroom apartment due to their relative poverty compared to their friends.\nDespite this apparent closeness with his friends, Jude finds himself unable to divulge either details of his past or current state of mind to his roommate. Nonetheless, he thrives in his law practice and develops a close parent-child relationship with his former professor, Harold, and his wife Julia, which results in the pair adopting him when Jude turns thirty. While thankful, the time before the adoption is filled with further bouts of self-harm as Jude believes he is inherently unworthy of affection. Meanwhile, the rest of the group finds success in their respective fields, with Willem becoming a star of theater and then film. JB finds success as an artist but also becomes addicted to crystal meth. The group stages an intervention, where JB mocks Jude by doing a crude imitation of his limp. In spite of successful treatment and a great deal of apologizing, Jude finds it impossible to forgive JB. Willem refuses to forgive him too, causing the group to fragment, with only Malcolm remaining friends with all four members.\nIt becomes clear that Jude was sexually traumatized at a very young age, making it difficult for him to engage in romantic relationships. His friends and loved ones begin questioning this isolation as he enters his forties, with Willem especially being baffled with regards to Jude's sexuality. As his loneliness grows more intense, he enters an abusive relationship with fashion executive Caleb, who is disgusted by Jude's limp and his increasing use of a wheelchair. Jude finally breaks off the relationship after Caleb rapes him, and they meet a final time when Caleb follows him to a dinner with Harold, humiliates him, and then follows Jude to his apartment where he brutally beats and rapes him, leaving him for dead. Jude nonetheless refuses to report the incident to the police, believing he deserved it. Only Harold and Andy, Jude's doctor and ongoing confidante, know the truth of the failed relationship.\nAlthough Jude's body manages to heal, the rapes cause him to flashback to his childhood wherein he was raised in a monastery and repeatedly sexually abused by the brothers.  He recalls a period when one of the brothers, Brother Luke, ran away with him, forcing him into years of child prostitution. After he was rescued by the police, Jude was placed in state care, where the abuse continued at the hands of the counselors there. After the break-up with Caleb brings back this childhood trauma, Jude finally decides to kill himself, but he survives the attempt. In the aftermath, Willem comes back home and begins to live with him. Jude continues to refuse therapy but begins to tell Willem the least traumatic stories about his childhood, which Willem finds disturbing and horrifying. The two soon begin a relationship, but Jude continues to struggle with opening up, and does not enjoy having sex with him.\nIn an attempt to curb his cutting, Jude decides to instead burn himself as a form of self-harm, but accidentally inflicts third degree burns that requires a skin graft. The wound is so severe that Andy tells him he has to tell Willem what happened, or else he will do it for him. Before Jude can tell Willem, Andy accidentally divulges the information. Willem is horrified, but after a difficult fight, Jude finally confesses that he does not enjoy sex and tells Willem about the years of sexual and physical abuse he endured. He also reveals that the damage to his legs was caused by a man called Dr. Traylor, who picked him up after he ran away from state care at age 15 and held him captive, eventually running him over with his car.\nThe relationship continues, with Willem sleeping with women and not with Jude. The two settle into a comfortable life together, which is shaken when Jude's legs become worse, and he must reluctantly amputate. He manages to learn to walk again with his new prosthetics, and the pair enter a period of their life which Willem dubs \"The Happy Years\". However, while picking up Malcolm and his wife from the train station for a visit, Willem is involved in a car accident with a drunk driver which kills all three occupants. With his two closest friends dead, Jude descends once again into self-destructive habits, losing such an excessive amount of weight that his remaining loved ones stage another intervention. Though they are able to get him to gain weight and to attend therapy, years of depression and despair finally overtake Jude and he takes his own life.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nA Little Life is divided into seven separate parts, and follows a chronological narrative with flashbacks frequently interspersed throughout. The novel's narrative perspectives shift throughout the story's progression. During the beginning of the novel, a third person omniscient perspective privileging one of Jude's, Willem's, JB's, or Malcolm's thoughts is utilized.  As the story gradually shifts its focus towards Jude, its perspective progressively molds entirely around each character's interactions with Jude and the experiences of Jude himself. This literary perspective is punctuated by first person narratives told from an unspecified future by an older Harold.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== Male relationships ===\nA core focus of the novel is the evolution of the relationships between Jude, Willem, JB, Malcolm, and Jude's adoptive father Harold. Jude's life in particular is populated by men who love and care about him as well as men that exploit and abuse him, and those who fall in the liminal spaces between the two categories. The social and emotional lives of each male character are the fabric that weaves the novel together, creating an insular narrative bubble that provides few clues about the historical moment in which the story is situated.Yanagihara confines the reader's perspective and emphasizes the examination of the distinct interior lives of each character and the people that populate and influence their lives. There are few women dispersed throughout the story, as a result, the novel can be considered a rumination on the strengths and the limits of romantic love, friendship, and relationships among men.\nDespite the various iterations of relationships and attempts to connect with Jude, his existence is often stagnated by isolation and loneliness in dealing with trauma and pain. His few attempts to reach out and connect with others during his adult life manifest in the repetition of yet another cycle of sexual abuse and trauma \u2013 his relationship with Caleb. The flashbacks to his abusive experiences with Dr. Traylor, Brother Luke, and boy's home counselors demonstrate the moral and affective extremes of abuse and exploitation that he experiences. Yet the novel invites juxtaposition by way of narration from Harold who shows a father's unconditional benevolent love to his adopted son.\n\n\n=== Trauma, recovery, and support ===\nIn an article written for New York Magazine, Yanagihara states that \u201cone of the things [she] wanted to do with this book was create a protagonist who never got better\u2026 [for him] to begin healthy (or appear so) and end sick \u2013 both the main character and the plot itself\u201d. The first sixteen years of Jude's life, plagued by sexual, physical, and psychological abuse, continue to haunt him as he enters adulthood. His trauma directly affects his mental and physical health, relationships, beliefs, and the ways in which he navigates the world. He struggles to move beyond the damage the past has wrought upon his body and psyche.\nOther than Ana, Jude's deceased case manager who predates the novel's beginning, and Willem later in the novel, he divulges almost none of his past to those close to him. The failure to understand Jude's trauma and the subsequent frustration that stems from his inability to build mutual networks of support among his friends and family is a constant point of tension in the novel. Jude's friends, including Andy, are constantly plagued by doubts about the ethical choices such as allowing Jude to live independently while harboring the knowledge of his physically self-destructive behavior. Throughout the novel, Jude constantly apologizes for his actions and inability to take the help that would be given to him.\n\n\n=== Chronic pain, disability, and self-harm ===\nA Little Life depicts the everyday experience of living with trauma, chronic pain, and disability, demonstrating the inherent intersections with one another. As a direct result of Dr. Traylor running him over with a car, Jude's spinal injuries have long-term health effects that trouble him for the rest of his life. He is prone to episodes of intense pain due to severed nerves in his back, lesions forming on his legs, and has difficulty walking. His insistent inclination towards independence manifests in the ways he constantly resists and fights his body as it breaks down with age, despite numerous treatments and surgeries. Jude continually attempts to take control of his body and his emotions by self-harming. His life is structured around pain and the anticipation of pain. As Jude grows older, he loathes the increasing dependence he must have on devices such as wheelchairs, canes, and relying on the care of others.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReview aggregator website Book Marks reported three negative and three mixed reviews among 22 total, signifying positive critical response. On the site, 11 critics gave the book a rave review, whilst the remaining 5 expressed positive impressions. The novel received positive reviews from The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, and other publications.In The Atlantic, Garth Greenwell suggested that A Little Life is \"the long-awaited gay novel\": \"It engages with aesthetic modes long coded as queer: melodrama, sentimental fiction, grand opera. By violating the canons of current literary taste, by embracing melodrama and exaggeration and sentiment, it can access emotional truth denied more modest means of expression.\"In the London Review of Books, Christian Lorentzen referred to the main character's \"gothic inverted fairytale origins\" and \"ghastly litany of childhood sexual abuse.\" The characters, he wrote, \"seem like stereotypical middle-class strivers plucked out of 1950s cinema.\" He asked in regard to a minor character who became a crystal meth addict, \"What real person trapped in this novel wouldn't become a drug addict?\"Yanagihara appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers to discuss the book. In July 2015, the book was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and made the shortlist of six books in September 2015. In 2019, A Little Life was ranked 96th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.Awards\n\n2015 Man Booker Prize, shortlist\n2015 National Book Award for Fiction, finalist\n2015 Kirkus Prize in Fiction, won\n2016 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, shortlist\n2016 Women's Prize for Fiction, shortlist\n2017 International Dublin Literary Award, shortlist\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe theatre company Toneelgroep Amsterdam debuted an adaptation of A Little Life on September 23, 2018 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Ivo van Hove directed the adaptation, which had a run time of over four hours. Van Hove collaborated with Yanagihara on the script after being given copies of the novel by two friends. Ramsey Nasr plays the lead, Jude St. Francis, in the adaptation which received positive reviews. Theatre critic Matt Trueman wrote that, despite the play's sometime suffocating trauma and violence, it \"is van Hove at his best, theatre that leaves an ineradicble mark.\"\n\n\n== References

based in St. Louis, Missouri. It produces and markets pet food, treats and cat litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina One. The company was formed in 2001 by combining Nestl\u00e9's Friskies Petcare Company with Ralston Purina, which acquired it for $10.3 billion. As of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and the largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Corporate history ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1894, William H. Danforth, partnered with George Robinson and William Andrews, entered the business of feeding farm animals by founding the Robinson-Danforth Commission Company. The name was changed to Ralston Purina in 1902.Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare was formed in December 2001, when Nestl\u00e9 acquired Ralston Purina for $10.3 billion and merged it with Nestl\u00e9's pet food business, Friskies PetCare Company. Ralston had marketed the Dog Chow, Cat Chow and Pro Plan pet food brands, while Nestl\u00e9 produced Friskies and Alpo brand pet foods.The merger was opposed by consumer advocates, such as the Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns. The two companies combined would become the largest pet food brand by market-share with a 45 percent share of the cat food market. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners, creating the separate Meow Mix Company. Ralston's St. Louis, Missouri location was chosen as the new company's North America headquarters.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nNestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare continued integrating the two companies through 2002. It cut back dry dog food manufacturing at facilities inherited from Friskies PetCare Company in Jefferson, Wisconsin, St. Joseph, Missouri and Arden Hills, Minnesota, then moved those operations to manufacturing facilities acquired from Ralston. Expanded manufacturing facilities were planned in Dunkirk, New York and the St. Joseph location was later expanded for wet-food production. In Asia it shifted from a \"dealer system\" to managing its own distribution. In 2004 Nestl\u00e9 Purina merged its North American and Latin America operations into a Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare Americas division.In 2003, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare formed a partnership with the Canine Health Foundation to advance veterinary research. The following year the company donated 80 tons of pet food to pets affected by Hurricane Charley in Florida and donated $100,000 to local animal shelters. Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare grew from about 11 percent of Nestl\u00e9's revenues in 2001, to one-third by 2005. By 2006 it was the largest market-share holder in the pet food industry with 32 percent of the market.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nBy 2009, Purina was one of Nestl\u00e9's fastest growing divisions, due to an increasing willingness by consumers to spend more money on petcare. In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand. Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned solar panel system in the state. In September 2010, Nestl\u00e9 reached an agreement to acquire Waggin' Train, a producer of pet treats with $200 million in annual revenues.In 2013, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare acquired the pet adoption website Petfinder. The following year it acquired Zuke's, a producer of cat and dog treats. From 2010 to 2012, Nestl\u00e9 expanded its manufacturing operations in Australia, Hungary and Germany. It also implemented the company's largest solar panel farm at its facilities in Atlanta, Georgia. In April 2014, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare opened the first cat cafe in the US.In February 2019, the company announced plans to spend $115 million to expand its factory in Bloomfield, Missouri, to support the demand for Tidy Cats. In November, the company invested $320 million in an old textile factory in Hartwell, Georgia.In April 2020, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare acquired Lily's Kitchen, a UK-based natural pet food brand.Purina has partnerships with several non-profit organizations, including Urban Resource Institute, which operates pet-friendly domestic violence shelters in New York City.\n\n\n=== Legal issues ===\nIn May 2014, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare began a legal dispute with Blue Buffalo regarding its advertising practices.  Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn, whereas Purina said independent lab tests confirmed that they do. Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter-suit less than a week later. It also alleged Purina was engaging in what it characterized as a \"smear campaign\". The National Advertising Review Board and the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo's advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated. Blue Buffalo said it disagreed, but would obey the ruling.In 2015, after a dog died and others got sick, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Purina alleging that the company's Beneful brand of dog food contained propylene glycol and mycotoxins produced by mold found in grains \u2014 grain being a major ingredient in Beneful.  The lawsuit was unsuccessful when the judge ruled that the plaintiff's attorneys did not prove that the food caused the dogs' illnesses, and the dog's death was found to have been caused by a heart tumor.In April 2017, another lawsuit, regarding Purina's Beggin' line of dog food and the accusation that its advertising fooled consumers into thinking that it was full of bacon, was dropped.\n\n\n=== Recalls ===\nIn 2005, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare voluntarily recalled all of its dry pet food produced from a plant in La Encrucijada, Venezuela after an internal investigation verified contaminants that were causing illnesses in pets. According to Fortune Magazine, in 2007 the pet food market \"plunged into turmoil\" due to the widespread discovery of contaminated ingredients. During this period, Nestle Purina voluntarily recalled some of its Alpo Prime Cuts in Gravy product in the US that contained wheat gluten from China contaminated with melamine.In August 2013 Purina recalled some of its Purina ONE Beyond dog food, because of one bag that was found to contain salmonella. In 2012 a consumer sued Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare when his pet died after eating Waggin' Train treats. The Food and Drug Administration received more than 900 reports from grieving pet owners that alleged the treat was causing illness or death in their pets due to chicken products from China. The FDA had issued warnings regarding these ingredients, but lab tests repeatedly confirmed there were no contaminants. Later that year, another consumer started a petition on Change.org asking retailers to voluntarily stop carrying the product. The petition attracted 60,000 signatures. The following year, Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek dog treats were voluntarily taken off the market temporarily after the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets identified trace amounts of antibiotic residue, which is allowed in Europe and China, but not approved in the US. In early 2014, a $6.5 million settlement was reached, pending approval by the court. According to The Washington Post, the company later re-introduced the brands after \"revamping its manufacturing process and overhauling its supply chain.\"\n\n\n== Products and services ==\nAccording to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare's pet food brands that contribute substantially to revenue include Purina, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Purina Beneful and Purina ONE. Some brands, such as Alpo are intended for budget shoppers, while others like Purina ONE and Beneful cost more and are for health or ingredient conscious consumers. Purina ONE has been its fastest-growing brand.The company introduced an appetizer cat food, Fancy Feast Appetizers, in 2009. A Purina Pro Plan line for senior dogs was introduced in 2010. It contains medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) for brain function and has whole grains for digestion. A grain-free product, Purina ONE Beyond, was introduced in 2011. Purina Pro Plan Sport, which contains extra fat and protein and is intended for athletic dogs, was made available in 2013. In 2014 Purina introduced a product for the growing Brazilian market called Ravena, which used locally available ingredients, such as acerola and jabuticaba fruits. Purina-branded accessories, such as training pads, beds, leashes and cleaners began being sold in 2011 under the Purina PetGear name through brand licensing agreements with other manufacturers.Purina's significant brands and product lines include:\n\n\n== Marketing and advertising ==\nIn the mid-1970s, the Purina Cat Chow brand launched the \"Chow-Chow-Chow\" advertising campaign, variations of which would run for the next 20 years. The television commercials featured cats seemingly dancing the cha-cha-cha, by means of a post-production and editing trick that involved rapidly playing the film forward and backward, giving the humorous illusion of the cats dancing as they walked or ran in time with the music. The earliest such spots featured character actress Patsy Garrett, who would appear in several other Cat Chow spots as an official spokesperson for many more years.In 2006, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare introduced a sponsored email application, Doggie-Mail, that could send messages online through a talking dog. In 2009 it sponsored the PawNation.com site developed by AOL, which hosted crowd-sourced pet videos, tips, Q&As and other content about pet ownership. Purina also sponsored Martha Stewart's pet tips site, Living Omnimedia. The company introduced an advertising campaign for the Alpo brand with the slogan \"Real dogs eat meat\". In the ad, over-pampered pets were \"rescued\" and fed Alpo, implying that pets needed to stay in touch with their primal nature by eating real meat. In 2009 it released a free iPhone app called \"petcentric places\" that allows users to map local pet-related locations, like dog parks or pet-friendly hotels. In 2010, Purina released a branded Facebook game called Purina Pet Resort, where players manage a virtual pet resort.In 2011, Nestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare became the official sponsor of the Westminster show hosted by the American Kennel Club. The company introduced a competition for pet owners to win a part-time job earning $50,000 annually to travel with their cat, interview other pet owners and write for the Purina website. Nestle Purina also produced television advertisements intended for Austria that had audio effects only pets could hear. It was the first set of advertisements targeting pets directly, rather than their owners.In 2012, Purina and another Nestl\u00e9 business, Jenny Craig, jointly created \"Project: Pet Slim Down\", an online program intended to help pets and pet owners lose weight together. Grumpy Cat became a \"spokescat\" for the Friskies brand in late 2013. In 2013, Purina featured ads during the Westminster Show that featured crowd-sourced videos submitted to Purina in response to the question \"How is Your Dog Great?\"\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Headquarters ===\nNestl\u00e9 Purina Petcare is operated as a subsidiary of Nestl\u00e9. It is headquartered in St Louis, Missouri and has operations in North America, Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and Oceania. There are sixteen buildings on 50 acres at its headquarters, including a 15-story main tower, four-story research facility built in 2010 and a Learning and Training center built in 2011.

On December 12, 2001, it merged with Swiss food-giant Nestl\u00e9's Friskies division to form Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare Company.\n\n\n== History ==\nRalston Purina (originally  Ralston-Purina) traces its roots to 1894, when founder William H. Danforth established the animal feed company Purina Mills. Danforth, formed a partnership with George Robinson; William Andrews, entered the business of feeding farm animals by founding the Robinson-Danforth Commission Company. Its predominant brand for each animal was generally referred to as \"Chow\"; hence \"Purina Horse Chow\", \"Purina Dog Chow\", \"Purina Cat Chow\", \"Purina Rabbit Chow\", \"Purina Pig Chow\", and \"Purina Monkey Chow\".\nLater, the company began producing cereal, which received endorsement by Webster Edgerly, founder of Ralstonism, to market Ralston breakfast cereals. Edgerly was at the time promoting the consumption of whole-grain cereal. These cereals became so successful that the name of the enterprise was changed in 1902 to the Ralston-Purina Company.In 1986, Ralston Purina sold Purina Mills, its US animal feed business, to British Petroleum. Purina Mills is now owned by Land O'Lakes. In 1994, the Ralston \"human food\" operations of the Ralston Purina Company were spun off into a new company called Ralcorp Holdings. In 1998, Ralston Purina spun off its international animal feed business as Agribrands, which was acquired by Cargill in 2001. The animal feed businesses continue to use the Purina and Chow brands, which Purina Mills and Cargill license for use in the US and internationally, respectively.\n\n\n=== Merger with Nestl\u00e9 ===\nRalston Purina became the subject of an acquisition bid by Swiss-based Nestl\u00e9, whose Friskies brand was the other leading US brand of pet food.  Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and Ralston Purina announced in January 2001 a definitive merger agreement. Under the agreement, Nestl\u00e9 acquired all of Ralston Purina's (NYSE: RAL) outstanding shares for US$33.50 per share in cash. The offer represented a premium of 36% over the closing price on Friday, January 12, 2001. The transaction had an enterprise value of US$10.3 billion ($10.0 billion equity plus $1.2 billion of net debt, minus $0.9 billion of financial investments).\nBoth corporations saw this major strategic transaction as the ideal way to benefit from their combined know-how, complementary strengths, and international presence in the growing pet-care market. Several brands of pet food (e.g., \"Meow Mix\") had to be divested separately to meet antitrust concerns. Purina brands are now made and marketed by a division of Nestl\u00e9 (Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare) which is still headquartered in St. Louis.\nWhile primarily a pet-food company, Ralston Purina also made some other pet-related products, such as Tidy Cats brand and Yesterday's News cat litter, which is made from recycled newspaper, purchased from Edward Lowe Industries in 1990. Also, Purina has honoured several Canadian animals every year since 1968 in their Animal Hall of Fame. The latest inductees included a police service dog which \"rushed and subdued an armed robber\".\n\n\n== Acquisitions and diversifications ==\nIn 1977, Ralston Purina acquired Missouri Arena Corporation and the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League franchise.  During the company's ownership of the team, they changed the name of the St. Louis Arena to the Checkerdome, reflecting the Ralston Purina logo.  The franchise was sold to Harry Ornest on July 27, 1983.\nRalston Purina purchased the Eveready Battery Company in 1986, owner of the Eveready and Energizer brands. The company was spun off in 2000.\nRalston Purina purchased Continental Baking Company, makers of Wonder bread and Hostess cakes, from ITT in 1984.  Ralston spun off Continental Baking Company, subsequently bought by Irving, Texas\u2013based Interstate Brands Corporation (IBC).\nRalston Purina opened test market pizza stores called Checkerboard Pizza in 1986. The format was similar to Domino's and Little Caesars.  They opened the stores in markets such as Moorhead, Minnesota, to test how the Midwestern market would accept the concept.  They did well, but Ralston Purina decided not to enter the pizza franchise business and closed all pilots by late 1987.\nRalston Purina owned and further developed the Keystone ski resort in Colorado.  \"Checkerboard Flats\" for kids and beginners at Keystone still bears their logo.  In 1993, Ralston Purina also bought Breckenridge ski area for an undisclosed amount, from Victoria U.S.A. Inc, a Japanese sporting goods retailer. However, both ski resorts were sold in 1997 to Vail Resorts for $331 million.Ralston Purina also owned Jack in the Box fast food restaurants from 1968 to 1985, along with several high-end restaurants.Ralston Purina owned Van Camp Sea Food Company from 1963 to 1988, a tuna cannery with Chicken of the Sea as its main product.Ralston Purina owned an animal pharmaceutical company in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nRalston Purina's \"checkerboard\" trademark was introduced in 1902. It was inspired by William Danforth's childhood memory of a family dressed in clothing made from the same bolt of checkerboard cloth. The company's headquarters was called Checkerboard Square. Danforth used the design as the visualization of a concept put forth in his book I Dare You, in which he proposed that four key components in life (\"Physical\", \"Mental\", \"Social\", and \"Religious\") need to be in balance, and one area was not to develop at the expense of the others. In 1921, the design inspired the design of feed that was pressed in cubes, called \"checkers\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLouisville sewer explosions\nRalcorp\nPurina Mills\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPurina Mobile Website\nCargill's Purina division (international animal feed brand)\nAgribrands Purina Canada Inc.

The doughnut is deep-fried in oil, filled with jam or custard, and then topped with powdered sugar. The doughnut recipe originated in Europe in the 1500s and by the 1800s was known as a Berliner in Germany. Polish Jews, who called it a ponchik, fried the doughnut in schmaltz rather than lard due to kashrut laws. The ponchik was brought to pre-state Israel by Polish Jewish immigrants, where it was renamed the sufganiyah based on the Talmud's description of a \"spongy dough\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn Hanukkah, Jews observe the custom of eating fried foods in commemoration of the miracle associated with the Temple oil. The tradition of eating deep-fried pastries on Hanukkah was considered ancient even in the time of the 12th-century rabbi Maimonides, whose father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef, wrote that \"one must not make light of the custom of eating sofganim [fried fritters] on Chanukah. It is a custom of the Kadmonim [the ancient ones]\". These sofganim were likely syrup-soaked fried cakes, akin to modern zalabiya in the Arab world.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Hebrew word sufganiyah is a neologism for pastry, based on the Talmudic words sofgan and sfogga, which refer to a \"spongy dough\". The word has also been compared to the Modern Hebrew word for sponge (sfog, Hebrew: \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u200e; isfanj, Arabic: \u0625\u0633\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062c\u200e). Sfenj, a Maghrebi doughnut, comes from the same root.A popular Israeli folktale holds that the word \"sufganiyah\" comes from the Hebrew expression \"Sof Gan Yud-Heh\" (\"\u05e1\u05d5\u05e3 \u05d2\u05df \u05d9\u05d4\"), meaning \"the end of the Garden of the Lord\"  (referring to the Garden of Eden). According to the legend, when Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden by the Lord, He cheered them up by feeding them sufganiyot. No known commentator on the Tanakh supports this interpretation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to food historian Gil Marks, the recipe for a filled jelly doughnut was first published in a 1485 cookbook in Nuremberg, Germany. The \"Gef\u00fcllte Krapfen\" consisted of \"a bit of jam sandwiched between two rounds of yeast bread dough and deep-fried in lard\". This doughnut became popular in northern European countries from Denmark to Russia during the 1500s. In 19th-century Germany it began to be called a Berliner or a Bismarck, after German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.Among Polish Jews, the jelly doughnut was fried in oil or schmaltz rather than lard, due to kashrut laws. In Poland, these doughnuts were known as ponchiks. Polish Jewish immigrants to Palestine brought along their recipe as well as the tradition of serving them on Hanukkah. In Palestine, however, they took on a new name\u2014sufganiyot\u2014based on the Talmud's description of a \"spongy dough\" (see the Etymology section).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe ponchik-style sufganiyah was originally made from two circles of dough surrounding a jelly filling, stuck together and fried in one piece. Although this method is still practiced, an easier technique commonly used today is to deep-fry whole balls of dough, and then inject them with a filling through a baker's syringe (or a special industrial machine).Modern-day sufganiyot in Israel are made from sweet yeast dough, filled with plain red jelly (usually strawberry, sometimes raspberry), and topped with powdered sugar. More expensive versions (priced at up to $3 per sufganiyah) are stuffed with dulce de leche, chocolate cream, vanilla cream, cappuccino, halva, creme espresso, chocolate truffle, or araq, and topped with various extravagant toppings, from coconut shavings and tiny vials of liquor to meringue and fruit pastes. In 2014 one Jerusalem bakery produced sufganiyah dough saturated with flavored vodka.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Mini sufganiyot ===\nIn 2016, Israeli bakeries began downsizing sufganiyot to appeal to health-conscious consumers, following an anti-junk food campaign by Health Minister Yaakov Litzman. The usual 100-gram (3.5 oz) size, packing 400 to 600 calories (1,700 to 2,500 kJ), now appears in 50-gram (1.8 oz) size with different fillings and toppings, earning the name \"mini.\"\n\n\n== Popularity ==\n\n\n=== In Israel ===\nUntil the 1920s, sufganiyot and latkes were of comparable popularity in Pre-state Israel during the Hanukkah holiday. The Histadrut, Israel's national labor union formed in 1920, pushed to replace the homemade latke with the sufganiyah as Israel's quintessential Hanukkah food in order to provide more work for its members. Commercial bakeries began selling sufganiyot days and weeks before Hanukkah began, lengthening the employment period. Their effort was successful, and sufganiyot became the most popular food for Hanukkah in Israel. By the 21st century, more Israeli Jews report eating sufganiyot on Hanukkah than fasting on Yom Kippur.Today sufganiyot are sold by Israeli bakeries as early as September. Angel Bakeries, the largest bakery in Israel, reportedly fries up more than 25,000 sufganiyot every day during the eight-day Hanukkah festival itself. Each batch uses 100 kg (220 lb) of dough and makes 1,600 sufganiyot. Local newspapers add to the excitement by rating the \"best sufganiyah in town\".The Ministry of Defense buys upwards of 400,000 sufganiyot for its soldiers each Hanukkah. As the troops overwhelmingly prefer jelly-filled doughnuts, the Defense Ministry purchases 80% with jelly filling and 20% with chocolate filling.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== In other Jewish communities ===\n\nUntil the late 1970s, latkes were the traditional Hanukkah food in the United States. The sufganiyah was introduced by American Jews who had visited or studied in Israel, and by Israeli Jews who had settled in the U.S. Today bakeries in many Jewish communities sell sufganiyot, as do non-kosher bakeries. The doughnut chains Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Kreme purvey sufganiyot in their kosher-certified outlets.Sufganiyot are also sold in kosher shops in Europe. Smaller Jewish communities in Russia and Ukraine organize special \"community bakes\" to prepare sufganiyot for school and kindergarten parties.\n\n\n== Savory varieties ==\nSavory sufganiyot also exist. In 2018, The Jerusalem Post reported on a new trend of savory sufganiyot in Manhattan eateries, in which the dough is filled with chicken schnitzel, lamb bacon, liver, or pastrami. Other savory varieties include:\n\nPanzerotti in Italy, filled with mozzarella and tomato sauce.\nLachmazikas in Spain, filled with everything from lamb and mushrooms to whitefish, ricotta, peppers, and herbs.\nSambusa-inspired savory sufganiyot, filled with lentils and peas, are popular among Iraqi Jews in Israel.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBimuelos \u2013 Fritters served on Hanukkah by Sephardi Jews\nCulture of Israel\nFritas de prasa\nIsraeli cuisine\nLatkes\nList of doughnut varieties\nSfenj\nZalabiyeh\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaking non-traditional sufganiyot: a demonstration video with Phyllis Glazer\nSufganiyot \u2013 The Best (in Hebrew)\nThe best Hanukkah sufganiyot in IsraelDessert () is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China and India, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\nThe term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.  Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"dessert\" originated from the French word desservir, meaning \"to clear the table.\" Its first known use was in 1600, in a health education manual entitled Naturall and artificial Directions for Health, written by William Vaughan. In his A History of Dessert (2013), Michael Krondl explains it refers to the fact dessert was served after the table had been cleared of other dishes. The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century when \"service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with \"service \u00e0 la russe\" (presenting a meal in courses.)\"\n\n\n== Other names ==\nThe word \"dessert\" is most commonly used for this course in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States, while it is one multiple synonyms (indluding \"pudding\", \"sweet\" and \"afters\") in United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, including Hong Kong and India.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia and ancient India and other ancient civilizations. Dried fruit and honey were probably the first sweeteners used in most of the world, but the spread of sugarcane around the world was essential to the development of dessert.Sugarcane was grown and refined in India before 500 BC and was crystallized, making it easy to transport, by AD 500. Sugar and sugarcane were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 300 BC and China by AD 600.  In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and desserts for over a thousand years. Sugarcane and sugar were little known and rare in Europe until the twelfth century or later when the Crusades and then colonization spread its use.\nHerodotus mentions that, as opposed to the Greeks, the main Persian meal was simple, but they would eat many desserts afterwards.Europeans began to manufacture sugar in the Middle Ages, and more sweet desserts became available. Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions.  The first apple pie recipe was published in 1381. The earliest documentation of the term cupcake was in \"Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.The Industrial Revolution in Europe and later America caused desserts (and food in general) to be mass-produced, processed, preserved, canned, and packaged.  Frozen foods, including desserts, became very popular starting in the 1920s when freezing emerged.  These processed foods became a large part of diets in many industrialized nations.  Many countries have desserts and foods distinctive to their nations or region.\n\n\n== Ingredients ==\nSweet desserts usually contain cane sugar, palm sugar, brown sugar, honey, or some types of syrup such as molasses, maple syrup, treacle, or corn syrup. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are flour or other starches, Cooking fats such as butter or lard, dairy, eggs, salt, acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, and spices and other flavoring agents such as chocolate, peanut butter, fruits, and nuts. The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.\nSugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts.  The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts.  Egg whites can act as a leavening agent or provide structure.  Further innovation in the healthy eating movement has led to more information being available about vegan and gluten-free substitutes for the standard ingredients, as well as replacements for refined sugar.\nDesserts can contain many spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors. Salt and acids are added to desserts to balance sweet flavors and create a contrast in flavors. Some desserts are coffee-flavored, for example an iced coffee souffl\u00e9 or coffee biscuits. Alcohol can also be used as an ingredient, to make alcoholic desserts.\n\n\n== Varieties & elements ==\n\nDessert consist of variations of tasted, textures, and appearances. Desserts can be defined as a usually sweeter course that concludes a meal. This definition includes a range of courses ranging from fruits or dried nuts to multi-ingredient cakes and pies. Many cultures have different variations of dessert. In modern times the variations of desserts have usually been passed down or come from geographical regions. This is one cause for the variation of desserts. These are some major categories in which desserts can be placed.\n\n\n=== Cakes ===\n\nCakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour. Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour. Common flavorings include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa or extracts. They may be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the form of cupcakes and petits fours.\n\n\n==== Puddings ====\nPuddings are thickened with starches such as corn starch or tapioca.\n\n\n=== Small cakes & pastries ===\n\nA batched dough between a cake and pastry by the mix of ingredients. An Old French bescuit, commonly spelt in English as biscuit, is a derivation of Latin for twice-baked. A Dutch koekje, commonly spelt in English as cookie, is a derivation of cake-ie , meaning little cake.\nThis form of dough can have a texture that is crisp, hard, chewy, or soft \u2013 in the UK a biscuit is the former two and a cookie is typically the latter. Examples include a ginger nut, shortbread biscuit and chocolate chip cookie.\nOther small cakes and pastries can also be counted as under these terms, due to their size and relative simularity to cookies and biscuits, such as jaffa cakes and Eccles cakes. \n\n\n=== Confection ===\n\nConfection, also called candy, sweets or lollies, features sugar or honey as a principal ingredient. \nMany involve sugar heated into crystals with subtle differences. Dairy and sugar based include caramel, fudge and toffee or taffy. They are multiple forms of egg and sugar meringues. and similar confections. Unheated sugar co-adulate into icings, preservatives and sauces with other ingredients.\n\n\n==== Chocolate ====\nTheobroma cacao beans can be a substitute or more commonly mixed with sugar to form chocolate is  Pure, unsweetened dark chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids. Cocoa butter is also added in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate currently consumed is in the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture, with no milk or much less than milk chocolate.\n\n\n=== Custards ===\n\nThese kinds of desserts usually include a thickened dairy base. Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs. Baked custards include cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and flan. They are often used as ingredients in other desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.\n\n\n=== Deep-fried ===\n\nMany cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough. In many countries, a doughnut is a flour-based batter that has been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly. Fritters are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried. Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey. Churros are a deep-fried and sugared dough that is eaten as dessert or a snack in many countries. Doughnuts are most famous for being a trademark favorite of fictional character Homer Simpson from the animated television series The Simpsons.\n\n\n=== Frozen ===\n\nIce cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category. Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency. Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.\n\n\n=== Gelatin ===\n\nJellied desserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another thickening agent. They are traditional in many cultures. Grass jelly and annin tofu are Chinese jellied desserts. Y\u014dkan is a Japanese jellied dessert. In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are based on gelatin with fruit or whipped cream added. The vegetarian substitute for Gelatin is Agar. Marshmallow is also most commonly made with gelatin.\n\n\n=== Pastries ===\n\n Pastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a croissant or unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as shortbread. Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts, and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.\n\n\n==== Pies, cobblers, and clafoutis ====\n\nPies and cobblers are a crust with a filling. The crust can be either made from either a pastry or crumbs. Pie fillings range from fruits to puddings; cobbler fillings are generally fruit-based. Clafoutis are a batter with fruit-based filling poured over the top before baking.\n\n\n=== Sweet soups ===\n\nTong sui, literally translated as \"sugar water\" and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm soup or custard served as a dessert at the end of a meal in Cantonese cuisine. Tong sui are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other regional cuisines of China. Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term tong sui is not used.\n\n\n=== Wines ===\nDessert wines are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed at higher rates as a result. Examples include Sauternes and Tokaji Asz\u00fa.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nDessert examples\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== By continent ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nThroughout much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course following a meal. Fruit or fruit salad would be eaten instead, which may be spiced, or sweetened with a sauce. In some former colonies in the region, the colonial power has influenced desserts \u2013 for example, the Angolan cocada amarela (yellow coconut) resembles baked desserts in Portugal.\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\nIn Asia, desserts are often eaten between meals as snacks rather than as a concluding course. There is widespread use of rice flour in East Asian desserts, which often include local ingredients such as coconut milk, palm sugar, and tropical fruit. In India, where sugarcane has been grown and refined since before 500 BC, desserts have been an important part of the diet for thousands of years; types of desserts include burfis, halvahs, jalebis, and laddus.Dessert nowadays are made into drinks as well, such as Bubble Tea. It is originated in Taiwan, which locates in East Asia. Bubble tea is a kind of dessert made with flavor tea or milk with tapioca. It is well-known across the world.Recently, CNN Travel released a list of 50 of the world\u2019s best desserts after travelling around the world and one of the items on the list is cendol. While the origins of cendol are not confirmed, there have been reports that it either came from Malaysia or Indonesia. \n\n\n=== India ===\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nIn Ukraine and Russia, breakfast foods such as nalysnyky or blintz or oladi (pancake), and syrniki are served with honey and jam as desserts.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\nEuropean colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants.\n\n\n=== South America ===\n\nDulce de leche is a very common confection in Argentina. In Bolivia, sugarcane, honey and coconut are traditionally used in desserts. Tawa tawa is a Bolivian sweet fritter prepared using sugar cane, and helado de canela is a dessert that is similar to sherbet which is prepared with cane sugar and cinnamon. Coconut tarts, puddings cookies and candies are also consumed in Bolivia. Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and romeu e julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada). Peanuts are used to make pa\u00e7oca, rapadura and p\u00e9-de-moleque. Local common fruits are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream. In Chile, kuchen has been described as a \"trademark dessert.\" Several desserts in Chile are prepared with manjar, (caramelized milk), including alfajor, flan, cuchufli and arroz con leche. Desserts consumed in Colombia include dulce de leche, waffle cookies, puddings, nougat, coconut with syrup and thickened milk with sugarcane syrup. Desserts in Ecuador tend to be simple, and desserts are a moderate part of the cuisine. Desserts consumed in Ecuador include tres leches cake, flan, candies and various sweets.\n\n\n=== Oceania ===\nDesserts are typically eaten in Australia,  and most daily meals \"end with simple desserts,\" which can include various fruits. More complex desserts include cakes, pies and cookies, which are sometimes served during special occasions.\n\n\n== Market ==\nThe market for desserts has grown over the last few decades, which was greatly increased by the commercialism of baking desserts and the rise of food productions. Desserts are present in most restaurants as the popularity has increased.  Many commercial stores have been established as solely desserts stores. Ice cream parlors have been around since before 1800. Many businesses started advertising campaigns focusing solely on desserts.  The tactics used to market desserts are very different depending on the audience for example desserts can be advertised with popular movie characters to target children.  The rise of companies like Food Network has marketed many shows which feature dessert and their creation. Shows like these have displayed extreme desserts and made a game show atmosphere which made desserts a more competitive field.Desserts are a standard staple in restaurant menus, with different degrees of variety. Pie and cheesecake were among the most popular dessert courses ordered in U.S. restaurants in 2012.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nDessert foods often contain relatively high amounts of sugar and fats and, as a result, higher calorie counts per gram than other foods. Fresh or cooked fruit with minimal added sugar or fat is an exception.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese desserts\nCulinary art\nhRecipe \u2013 a microformat for marking-up recipes in web pages\n\n\n=== List articles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDodge, Abigail J.;  et al.

flex, or inflection (British English: inflexion) is a point on a smooth plane curve at which the curvature changes sign. In particular, in the case of the graph of a function, it is a point where the function changes from being concave (concave downward) to convex (concave upward), or vice versa.\nFor example, if the curve is the graph of a function y = f(x), of differentiability class C2, an inflection point of the curve is where f'', the second derivative of f, vanishes (f'' = 0) and changes its sign at the point (from positive to negative or from negative to positive). A point where the second derivative vanishes but does not change its sign is sometimes called a point of undulation or undulation point.\nIn algebraic geometry an inflection point is defined slightly more generally, as a regular point where the tangent meets the curve to order at least 3, and an undulation point or hyperflex is defined as a point where the tangent meets the curve to order at least 4.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nInflection points in differential geometry are the points of the curve where the curvature changes its sign.For example, the graph of the differentiable function has an inflection point at (x, f(x)) if and only if its first derivative, f', has an isolated extremum at x. (This is not the same as saying that f has an extremum).  That is, in some neighborhood, x is the one and only point at which f' has a (local) minimum or maximum.  If all extrema of f' are isolated, then an inflection point is a point on the graph of f at which the tangent crosses the curve.\nA falling point of inflection is an inflection point where the derivative is negative on both sides of the point; in other words, it is an inflection point near which the function is decreasing. A rising point of inflection is a point where the derivative is positive on both sides of the point; in other words, it is an inflection point near which the function is increasing.\nFor an algebraic curve, a non singular point is an inflection point if and only if the intersection number of the tangent line and the curve (at the point of tangency) is greater than 2.\nThe principal result is that the set of the inflection points of an algebraic curve coincides with the intersection set of the curve with the Hessian curve.\nFor a smooth curve given by parametric equations, a point is an inflection point if its signed curvature changes from plus to minus or from minus to plus, i.e., changes sign.\nFor a smooth curve which is a graph of a twice differentiable function, an inflection point is a point on the graph at which the second derivative has an isolated zero and changes sign.\n\n\n== A necessary but not sufficient condition ==\nIf the second derivative, f\u2033(x) exists at x0, and x0 is an inflection point for f, then f\u2033(x0) = 0, but this condition is not sufficient for having a point of inflection, even if derivatives of any order exist. In this case, one also needs the lowest-order (above the second) non-zero derivative to be of odd order (third, fifth, etc.). If the lowest-order non-zero derivative is of even order, the point is not a point of inflection, but an undulation point. However, in algebraic geometry, both inflection points and undulation points are usually called inflection points. An example of an undulation point is x = 0 for the function f given by f(x) = x4.\nIn the preceding assertions, it is assumed that f has some higher-order non-zero derivative at x, which is not necessarily the case. If it is the case, the condition that the first nonzero derivative has an odd order implies that the sign of f'(x) is the same on either side of x in a neighborhood of x. If this sign is positive, the point is a rising point of inflection; if it is negative, the point is a falling point of inflection.\nInflection points sufficient conditions:\n1) A sufficient existence condition for a point of inflection is:\n\nIf f(x) is k times continuously differentiable in a certain neighborhood of a point x with k odd and k \u2265 3, while f(n)(x0) = 0 for n = 2, \u2026, k \u2212 1 and f(k)(x0) \u2260 0 then f(x) has a point of inflection at x0.2) Another sufficient existence condition requires f\u2033(x + \u03b5) and f\u2033(x \u2212 \u03b5) to have opposite signs in the neighborhood of x (Bronshtein and Semendyayev 2004, p. 231).\n\n\n== Categorization of points of inflection ==\n\nPoints of inflection can also be categorized according to whether f'(x) is zero or nonzero.\n\nif f'(x) is zero, the point is a stationary point of inflection\nif f'(x) is not zero, the point is a non-stationary point of inflectionA stationary point of inflection is not a local extremum. More generally, in the context of functions of several real variables, a stationary point that is not a local extremum is called a saddle point.\nAn example of a stationary point of inflection is the point (0, 0) on the graph of y = x3. The tangent is the x-axis, which cuts the graph at this point.\nAn example of a non-stationary point of inflection is the point (0, 0) on the graph of y = x3 + ax, for any nonzero a. The tangent at the origin is the line y = ax, which cuts the graph at this point.\n\n\n== Functions with discontinuities ==\nSome functions change concavity without having points of inflection. Instead, they can change concavity around vertical asymptotes or discontinuities. For example, the function \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \u21a6\n        \n          \n            1\n            x\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto {\\frac {1}{x}}}\n   is concave for negative x and convex for positive x, but it has no points of inflection because 0 is not in the domain of the function.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCritical point (mathematics)\nEcological threshold\nHesse configuration formed by the nine inflection points of an elliptic curve\nOgee, an architectural form with an inflection point\nVertex (curve), a local minimum or maximum of curvature\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Inflection Point\".

They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5S, and were announced on September 9, 2014 and released on September 19, 2014. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7 and 5.5 inches (120 and 140 mm) displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications-based mobile payments offering.The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold very well, making it the best selling iPhone model and one of the most successful phones to date.\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed \"Bendgate\"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed \"Touch Disease\"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015.  The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016 when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe, before hitting the US markets in May 2017, and Canada in July 2017. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays\u2014which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications\u2014a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014 and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$649 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$749. In China, where the iPhone 5C and 5S were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers that it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th  there were \"details which are not ready\"; local media reported that the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged that iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's \"frequent locations\" function could expose \"state secrets.\"In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Pluses that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price.In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE.  As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.\nIn February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n\n=== Hardware ===\n\n\n==== Design ====\nThe design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.  The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.  Both models come in gold, silver, and \"space gray\" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.\n\n\n==== Displays ====\nThe most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as \"Retina HD Display\" and \"ion-strengthened\", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed \"dual-domain pixels\"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the power button was moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.\n\n\n==== Batteries ====\nThe iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable. Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.\n\n\n==== Chipsets ====\nBoth models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor\u2014an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.\n\n\n==== Connectivity ====\nThe expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s), for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s\u2014which is up to three times faster than 802.11n, along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay\u2014a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC. iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.\n\n\n==== Camera ====\n\nThe iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively. \nStill photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720\u00d71532).The camera also includes phase detection autofocus. The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization. The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.\n\n\n==== Sensors ====\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.\n\n\n=== Software ===\n\nWhen first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8, while the iPhone 5S was supplied pre-loaded with iOS 7. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and 5S can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional \"Reachability\" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a \"Back\" button in the top-left corner. In June 2019, Apple announced that it will drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it \"the best smartphone you can buy\". TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's \"brilliant\" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being \"smarter and more intuitive than ever\", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones \u2013 including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone. The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be \"simply and cleanly designed\" in comparison to the 5s, noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered \"good, even great, but there\u2019s little about it that\u2019s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It\u2019s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package\".In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.The iPhone 6 and 6+ have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840\u00d72160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264\u00d72448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264\u00d71836 pixels upscaled to 3840\u00d72160p.\n\n\n== Hardware issues ==\nThe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented \"error 53\" that appeared under certain circumstances.\n\n\n=== Bendgate (Chassis bending) ===\nShortly after its public release, it was reported that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as \"Bendgate\".Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating that they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is \"extremely rare.\" The company maintained that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use. The company offered to replace phones that were bent, if it is determined that the bending was unintentional.\n\n\n=== Hair ripping ===\nOn October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming that certain iPhone 6\nand iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites that the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls. Twitter users claimed that the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 is to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.\n\n\n=== Flash storage performance ===\nSome users reported that 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported that the issues were connected to the triple-layer cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-layer cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-layer cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.\n\n\n=== iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues ===\nIt was reported that the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and \"wavy\"-looking videos. The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning that magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing that faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow \"shifted\", or out of place. Apple stated that they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said that the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.\n\n\n=== \"Error 53\" ===\nIf the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been \"re-validated\" for security reasons\u2014a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into \"Recovery Mode\" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an \"error 53\" message. Beyond the explanation that this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted that error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.\n\n\n=== Touchscreen failure (\"Touch disease\") ===\n\nTouchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill\u2014which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible \"sticker\". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display. iFixit reported that this issue, nicknamed \"touch disease\", was a byproduct of the previous \"Bendgate\" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of \"key points\" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum\u2014where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship. The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported that six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users that this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating that they were \"tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement\". The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit. On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported that based on data from four \"high-traffic\" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the \"touch disease\" problem.On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging that Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having \"long been aware\" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating that \"some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device\".\n\n\n== Sales ==\nApple Inc. announced that, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available\u2014an Apple record. 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. Apple iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release. Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales. During their lifetime, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sold a total of more than 220 million, making them the best selling iPhone models and one of the best selling mobile phones of all time. The exact total sales of the iPhone 6 are unknown, but it's estimated that roughly 222.4 million units of the iPhone 6 have been sold as of June 2017.\n\n\n== Timeline of models ==\n\n\n== See also
